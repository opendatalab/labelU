# Image Annotation

Annotation process description:

1. Determine whether the task is invalid; if so, click skip to proceed to the next image. If valid, when there are annotation tasks (object detection, semantic segmentation, line annotation, point annotation), the annotation tools and configuration are consistent.
2. On the global labels, you can select the pre-configured "label classification" to tag the entire image or provide a text explanation for the image under "text description".
3. For specific markings, first click the "tool style" in the upper left corner to select the marking method. After completing the style of the mark in the image, synchronize it in the label column on the right. The name of this label and other information can be modified manually by clicking on it.
4. Click on the label result in the label result management column on the right to select the corresponding mark in the image. The selected tool in the toolbar switches to the label result tool. Click "modify" for detailed information to drop down and select the label name; click the "hide" button to hide this marking information; click the "delete" button to delete this marking information.
5. Choose "Next", go to the next image.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until the annotation is complete.
